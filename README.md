# TODO

## Improvements

- python3 compatibility
- allow specifying ```gmx``` path
- ```make test``` for all tests
- identify properties by id instead of nature, allowing using the same property more than once (/e.g./ optimize using density at two temperatures)
  - gridOptimizer [DONE]
  - rest of code...

## Tests

- Surrogate models:
    - MBAR [DONE]
    - Interpolation [DONE]
        - Nearest [DONE]
        - Linear [DONE]
        - Cubic [DONE]

- GridOptimizer [DONE]

- Single simulation protocol call

- Full simple grid

# Possible Bugs

- Filtering seems to be filtering too much!
