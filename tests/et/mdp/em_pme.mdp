define          = -DFLEXIBLE    ; include flexible water
integrator      = steep         ; Algorithm (steep = steepest descent minimization)
emtol           = 1.0           ; Stop minimization when the maximum force < 1.0 kJ/mol
nsteps          = 1000        ; Maximum number of (minimization) steps to perform
nstenergy       = 10            ; Write energies to disk every nstenergy steps
nstxtcout       = 10            ; Write coordinates to disk every nstxtcout steps
xtc_grps        = System        ; Which coordinate group(s) to write to disk
energygrps      = System        ; Which energy group(s) to write to disk
;
; Parameters describing how to find the neighbors of each atom and how to
