The name for the protocol.

type
required
string
The type of the protocol (see :doc:`/overview/protocols`).

system
required
objname
The name of the system with which the protocol is associated.
Depends on the system to which it refers.

coords
required
objname
The name of the coordinates with which the protocol is associated.
Depends on the coordinates to which it refers.

mdps
required
list path
The list of file paths of the input-parameter files (extension .mdp) for each step of the simulation workflow.
For type = gmx.

maxsteps
required
numerical
The maximum number of steps allowed for the length of the production run.
For type = gmx.
