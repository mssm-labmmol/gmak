The ``$optimize`` block sets up the composite properties that enter in the calculation of the score function, as well as their weights and uncertainty tolerances.
unique
none
type
optional
string
The type of the score function (for the default type, see :doc:`/overview/score`).
mergeable

properties
required
list objname
The names of the composite properties that enter in the score.
Depends on the properties to which it refers.

references
required
list numerical
The reference/target values of the properties in the score.
The value for each property should be compatible with the order in which it is listed in the ``properties`` option.
mergeable

weights
required
list numerical
The weights of the properties in the score.
The value for each property should be compatible with the order in which it is listed in the ``properties`` option.
mergeable

tolerances
required
list numerical
The uncertainty tolerances of the properties.
mergeable
The value for each property should be compatible with the order in which it is listed in the ``properties`` option.
