The ``$compute`` block sets up a composite property and the associated component properties (see :ref:`overview/properties:component and composite properties`).
nonunique
none
name
required
string
The name for the composite property.

type
required
string
The type of the composite property.

protocols
custom Type-specific
list objname
The names of the protocols on which the calculation of the component properties is based.
Depends on the protocols to which it refers.
Each composite-property type requires different protocols; see below.

surrogate_model
required
objname
The type of surrogate model used in the estimation of the component properties.

components
custom Required for custom properties only
list string
The types of the component properties involved in the custom composite property.

protocols
required
objname
The name of the protocol for which the property is calculated.
Depends on the protocol to which it refers.
Read the protocol requirements in :ref:`overview/properties:density`.
For type = density.

protocols
required
objname
The name of the protocol for which the property is calculated.
Depends on the protocol to which it refers.
Read the protocol requirements in :ref:`overview/properties:surface-tension coefficient`.
For type = gamma.

protocols
required
objname
The name of the protocol for which the property is calculated.
Depends on the protocol to which it refers.
Read the protocol requirements in :ref:`overview/properties:free-energy difference`.
For type = dg.

temperature
optional
numerical
The value of the reference temperature of the alchemical-transformation simulations. By default, it is inferred from the ``.mdp`` file of the production run.
For type = dg.

protocols
required
list objname objname objname
The names of the protocols for which the liquid-phase potential energy, gas-phase potential energy and polarization-energy correction, respectively, are calculated.
Depends on the protocols to which it refers.
Read the protocol requirements in :ref:`overview/properties:enthalpy of vaporization`.
The calculation of the gas-phase potential energy and/or the polarization-energy correction can be ignored by using ``none`` as the corresponding protocol names.
For type = dhvap.

nmols
required
numerical
The number of molecules in the liquid phase.
For type = dhvap.

mu
optional
numerical
The experimental value of the molecular dipole moment in the gas phase (in cubic nanometers).
For type = dhvap.
Required for polarization-energy correction. 

alpha
optional
numerical
The value of the molecular isotropic polarizability in the gas-phase (in Debye).
For type = dhvap.
Required for polarization-energy correction. 

C
optional
numerical
The value of the additional constant corrections (in kJ per mole; default is 0.0).
For type = dhvap.

temperature
optional
numerical
The value of the reference temperature. By default, it is inferred from the ``.mdp`` file of the production run of the liquid simulation.
For type = dhvap.
