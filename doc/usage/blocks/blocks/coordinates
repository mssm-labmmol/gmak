The ``$coordinates`` block sets up a routine for constructing initial configurations.
nonunique
none
name
required
string
The name chosen for the configuration-initialization routine.

type
required
string
The type of the configuration-initialization routine (see :doc:`/overview/coordinates`).

coords
required
path
The path of the recycled configuration file.
For type = any.

follow
required
objname
The name of the protocol from which the recycled configuration is retrieved.
For type = folllow.
Depends on the protocol to which it refers and on the :doc:`$grid <grid>` block.

coords
required
path
The path of a configuration file containing a single copy of the desired molecule.
For type = gmx_liquid.

nmols
required
numerical
The desired number of molecules.
For type = gmx_liquid.

box
required
union list string numerical | list string numerical numerical numerical
The type of box (``cubic`` or ``rectangular``) followed by the desired box dimensions (one length or a triple of lengths).
For type = gmx_liquid.

coords
required
list path path
A pair of configuration-file paths for the solute and solvent molecules.
For type = gmx_solvation.

nmols
required
list numerical numerical
A pair of integers specifying the desired number of solute and solvent molecules, respectively.
For type = gmx_solvation.

box
required
union list string numerical | list string numerical numerical numerical
The type of box (``cubic`` or ``rectangular``) followed by the desired box dimensions (one length or a triple of lengths).
For type = gmx_solvation.

coords
required
path
The path of a configuration file containing a single copy of the desired molecule.
For type = gmx_slab.

nmols
required
numerical
The desired number of molecules.
For type = gmx_slab.

box
required
union list string numerical | list string numerical numerical numerical
The type of box (``cubic`` or ``rectangular``) followed by the desired box dimensions (one length or a triple of lengths).
For type = gmx_slab.

axis
optional
string
The axis extended in preparing the simulation box. Possible values are x, y or z (default).
For type = gmx_slab.

factor
optional
numerical
The factor by which the length of the extended axis is multiplied (default is 5.0). 
For type = gmx_slab.

follow
required
objname
The name of the protocol from which the recycled pure-liquid configuration is retrieved.
For type = gmx_slab_follow.
Depends on the protocol to which it refers and on the :doc:`$grid <grid>` block.

factor
optional
numerical
The factor by which the length of the extended axis is multiplied (default is 5.0). 
For type = gmx_slab_follow.
